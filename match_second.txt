I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean lips
Burning cities and napalm skies
Thousands struggles inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm afraid
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes, yeah
